# SQL_REPO_0001
This project involves a basic analysis of a dataset that simulates a DVD rental system in SQL. The dataset consists of several tables about a variety of aspects of the rental process, including films, payment, customers, rentals, and more. 

## introduction

In this project, we use SQL queries to perform data analysis on a comprehensive DVD rental system dataset. The goal is to gain valuable insights from the data and answer various business questions related to the rental process, customer behavior, film categories, and more. SQL is used as the primary tool for data exploration and analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset for this project includes the following tables:
- `film`: Information about the films available for rental.
- `category`: Categories of films.
- `film_category`: Associations between films and categories.
- `film_actor`: Relationships between films and actors.
- `actor`: Details about actors.
- `language`: Languages available for films.
- `customer`: Information about customers.
- `address`: Customer addresses.
- `city`: Cities where stores are located.
- `country`: Countries associated with cities.
- `payment`: Payment transactions made by customers.
- `rental`: Rental transactions.
- `store`: Details about rental stores.
- `inventory`: Film inventory available at stores.
- `staff`: Staff information.

The analysis has been made by using various basic queries involving comparison operators, logical operators, and clauses like WHERE, LIMIT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. soon will be more complex queries like window (), CTE, and CASE.
